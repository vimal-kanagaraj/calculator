#  Calculator

## Features
- User needs to enter the numbers and operators in the command line.
- Supported Operations : Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
- Sample Inputs <br />
  `5+2` <br />
  `5+2*(3/2)` <br />
   `5+(2/3)*(3*(2/3))` <br />
- Output will be displayed to the user in the same command line interface where user entered the input.
- Input validation is done when user enters anything that is not appropriate for the calculator.

## Prerequisites to run the program
- Maven 
- JDK 1.8+

## Steps to run the program

## Assumptions
- Only positive integers can be entered as input. Output can be in decimal format.
- Both input and output will be less than Double data type's max value i.e. 1.7*10^308
- Following are the allowed operators for the calculator
	1. 	Addition  :  +
	2. 	Substraction :  -
	3. 	Multiplication :  *
	4. 	Division :  /
	
-  Following will be the order of precedence of the operators


Operator  | Description
------------- | -------------
()  |Brackets
*,/  | Multiplication , Division
+,- | Addition , Substraction

-  Precedence for Operators with equal precedence will be evaluated based on the order in which they appear in the expression from left to right


## Design approach
 - Expressions to be validated before evaluation.
 - Expression will be given in Infix notation format which is easier to be read by humans. But it is difficult to be parsed by machine. 
 - To resolve the above mentioned issue with Infix notation format, expression has to be converted into post fix notation format where it can be parsed easily by machines.
 - Expression can be converted into post fix notation format using Stacks data structure to place the operators based on their precedence.
 - Expression in post fix format can then be evaluated by using stacks to place the values for applying the sequence of arithmetic operations.
